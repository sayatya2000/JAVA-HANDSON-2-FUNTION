    <h1>Funtion</h1>
    <h1>DAY 1</h1>
    <h3>1.Create one function with zero parameter having a console statement;</h3>
    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <pre>
        function myFunction() {
            console.log("This is my function!");
          }
          myFunction(); 
    </pre>
    <h4>Output is My Funtion.</h4>
    <h4>Explanation:
        In this example, the `myFunction` function does not accept any parameters. Instead, it simply logs a message to the console using the `console.log` method.
To call the function and log the message to the console, we simply call the `myFunction` function as a standalone statement.
    </h4>


    <h3>2.Create one function which takes two values as a parameter and print the sum of them as "Sum of 3, 4 is 7"</h3>
    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    
    <pre>
        function addition(Num1,Num2){
            document.write(Num1+Num2);
        }
        addition(3,4);
    </pre>
    <h4>Output is 7.</h4>
    <h4>This function takes two numbers as arguments, logs a string with the sum of the numbers, and returns nothing. The string includes the values of num1, num2, and their sum, which is calculated by adding num1 and num2.</h4>

    <h3>3.Create one arrow function</h3>

    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <pre>
        const multiply = (num1, num2) => num1 * num2;
    </pre>
    <h4>Explanation: This arrow function takes two numbers as arguments, multiplies them together, and returns the result. The function is assigned to a variable called `multiply` using the `const` keyword, and the arrow function syntax is used to define the function. The arrow function takes two parameters, `num1` and `num2`, and returns their product, which is calculated using the `*` operator.</h4>
        
      <h3>4."Print output: </h3>
         <pre>
            var x = 21;
            var girl = function () {
                console.log(x);
                var x = 20;
            };
            girl ();"
         </pre>
          
        <h3>Ans.</h3>
        <h4>output is Undefined  </h4>
        <h4>This code defines a variable x with the value 21, and a function expression girl that logs the value of x to the console and then declares and initializes a local variable x with the value 20. When the girl function is called, the output is undefined because the local variable x is declared within the function using the var keyword, which means it is hoisted to the top of the function scope and initially has the value undefined.</h4>
        <h3>5.Print output: </h3>
            <pre>
                var x = 21;
                girl ();
                console.log(x)
                function girl() {
                    console.log(x);
                    var x = 20;
                };
            </pre>
            
            <h3>Ans.</h3>
            <h4>First output is Undefined and Second output is 21. </h4>
            <h4>This code defines a variable x with the value 21, then calls a function expression girl that logs the value of x to the console and then declares and initializes a local variable x with the value 20. However, since the girl function is called before the local variable x is declared, the output of the first console.log(x) statement inside the function is undefined. After the girl function call, the output of the final console.log(x) statement is 21 because it references the global variable x defined outside the function scope.</h4>
            <h3>6.Print output</h3>
            <pre>
                var x = 21;
                a();
                b();
                
                  function a() {
                    
                   x = 20;
                  console.log(x);
                };
                 function b() {
                    
                    x = 40;
                   console.log(x);
                };
            </pre>
            <h3>Ans.</h3>
            <h4>First output is 20 and Second output is 40.</h4>
            <h4>This code defines a global variable x with the value 21, then calls two functions a and b in sequence. Both a and b set the value of x to different values and then log the value of x to the console. The output of this code is 20 and 40, which correspond to the values set by a and b, respectively. Since both functions modify the same global variable x, the value of x at the end of the code execution is 40.</h4>

            <h1>DAY 2</h1>
            <h3>1.Guess the Output</h3>
            <pre>
                function FindSum(a, b){
                    return a + b;
                }
                
                function DisplayData(data, batch){
                    console.log(`i am from ${data} and My batch is EA${batch}`)
                }
                
                DisplayData(""PrepBytes"", FindSum(10, 9));
            </pre>
            <h3>Ans.</h3>
             <h4>i am from PrepBytes and My batch is EA19</h4>
             <h4>The code defines two functions, "FindSum" that takes two parameters and returns their sum, and "DisplayData" that takes two parameters, data and batch, and prints a string using those parameters.
                Then the function "DisplayData" is called with two arguments, the string "PrepBytes" and the result of calling the function "FindSum" with arguments 10 and 9. Therefore, the output of the code will be "i am from PrepBytes and My batch is EA19".</h4>

            <h3>2.Guess the output.</h3>
            <pre>
                Abc();
                const Abc = function(){
                    let value = 20;
                    console.log(value);
                }
            </pre>
            <h4>Explanation: The output will be an error because `Abc` is declared as a constant using `const` but it is called before it is defined, which means it does not exist at the time of the call. This results in a ReferenceError: "Cannot access 'Abc' before initialization".</h4>
          
            <h3>3.Guess the Output</h3>
            <pre>
                var a = 10;
               (function (){
                   console.log(a);
                   var a = 20;
               })();
            </pre>
            <h4>Ans.</h4>
            <h4>The Output is Undefined</h4>
            <h4>The output of this code will be `undefined`. This is because the `var a` declaration inside the immediately invoked function creates a new variable that is scoped to that function, so the `console.log(a)` statement is referring to the local variable `a` which has not been assigned a value yet, resulting in `undefined`.</h4>

            <h3>4.Guess the Output</h3>
            <pre>
                const greet =  function(name){
                    return function(m){
                    
                        console.log(`Hi!! ${name}, ${m}`);
                    }
                }
                  
                const greet_message = greet('EA22');
                greet_message("Welcome To PrepBytes")
            </pre>
            <h4>Ans.</h4>
            
            <h4>The output will be `"Hi!! EA22, Welcome To PrepBytes"`. This is because `greet` function returns another function that takes one argument `m` and when we call `greet_message` function with `"Welcome To PrepBytes"` argument, it executes the inner function of `greet` function and logs the message `"Hi!! EA22, Welcome To PrepBytes"`.</h4>
